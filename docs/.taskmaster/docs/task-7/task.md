# Task 7: Containerization and Deployment Setup

## Overview
This task implements Docker containerization and Kubernetes deployment configuration for the Rust API project. It establishes a complete deployment pipeline from local development with Docker Compose to production-ready Kubernetes manifests, enabling scalable and portable deployments.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Container Infrastructure
- **Multi-stage Docker Build**: Optimized image size with separate build and runtime stages
- **Docker Compose**: Local development environment with PostgreSQL
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Production deployment configuration
- **Health Probes**: Readiness and liveness checks for container health

### 2. Deployment Components
- **Dockerfile**: Efficient container image build process
- **Docker Compose**: Development environment orchestration
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Scalable application deployment
- **Kubernetes Service**: Load balancing and service discovery
- **Build Scripts**: Automated image building and deployment

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Multi-Stage Dockerfile
Location: `Dockerfile` (project root)

The Dockerfile uses a two-stage build process:
- **Build Stage**: Compiles the Rust application with all dependencies
- **Runtime Stage**: Minimal image with only runtime requirements

Key optimizations:
- Dependency caching through layer separation
- Minimal runtime image based on debian-slim
- Security-focused with only necessary packages
- Migrations included for database setup

### Step 2: Configure Docker Compose
Location: `docker-compose.yml`

Development environment setup:
- PostgreSQL database service
- API service with hot-reload capability
- Volume mounting for development
- Network configuration for service communication
- Environment variable management

### Step 3: Create Kubernetes Deployment
Location: `k8s/deployment.yaml`

Production deployment configuration:
- Replica management (3 instances by default)
- Resource limits and requests
- Health check probes
- Secret management for sensitive data
- Rolling update strategy

### Step 4: Define Kubernetes Service
Location: `k8s/service.yaml`

Service configuration for:
- Internal cluster routing
- Load balancing across pods
- Port mapping (80 → 3000)
- Service discovery via DNS

### Step 5: Build Automation Script
Location: `scripts/build_image.sh`

Automated Docker image building:
- Git commit-based tagging
- Latest tag management
- Build verification
- Error handling

### Step 6: Deployment Script
Location: `scripts/deploy_k8s.sh`

Kubernetes deployment automation:
- Namespace configuration
- Manifest application
- Deployment verification
- Rollout status checking

## Dependencies
- Task 5: Middleware and Advanced Features (application must be complete)
- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Kubernetes 1.24+
- kubectl CLI tool
- PostgreSQL 15

## Container Architecture

### Docker Image Layers
1. **Build Stage**: Full Rust toolchain for compilation
2. **Dependency Cache**: Separate layer for dependencies
3. **Application Build**: Source code compilation
4. **Runtime Stage**: Minimal Debian base
5. **Binary Copy**: Compiled application transfer
6. **Migration Copy**: Database migration files

### Kubernetes Architecture
- **Deployment**: Manages pod replicas and updates
- **Service**: Provides stable endpoint for pods
- **Secrets**: Secure storage for database credentials
- **Probes**: Health monitoring and self-healing

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start services
2. Access API at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Database available at `localhost:5432`
4. Logs available via `docker-compose logs`

### Production Deployment
1. Build image: `./scripts/build_image.sh`
2. Push to registry (if using remote)
3. Deploy to Kubernetes: `./scripts/deploy_k8s.sh`
4. Monitor rollout: `kubectl rollout status deployment/rust-basic-api`

## Health Monitoring
- **Readiness Probe**: Ensures pod is ready to accept traffic
- **Liveness Probe**: Restarts unhealthy pods
- **Startup Probe**: (Optional) Allows slow-starting containers

## Resource Management
- **Requests**: Minimum resources guaranteed
  - Memory: 128Mi
  - CPU: 100m
- **Limits**: Maximum resources allowed
  - Memory: 512Mi
  - CPU: 500m

## Success Criteria
- Docker image builds successfully
- Container runs without errors
- Docker Compose environment works
- Kubernetes deployment succeeds
- Health probes pass
- Service is accessible
- Scaling works correctly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Docker Build Fails
**Solution**: Check Rust version compatibility and dependency resolution

### Issue: Container Can't Connect to Database
**Solution**: Verify network configuration and connection strings

### Issue: Kubernetes Pods Not Starting
**Solution**: Check resource limits and secret configuration

### Issue: Health Probes Failing
**Solution**: Ensure /health endpoint is implemented and accessible

## Security Considerations
1. Use specific base image versions (not latest)
2. Run containers as non-root user
3. Implement network policies in Kubernetes
4. Use secrets for sensitive configuration
5. Scan images for vulnerabilities
6. Implement pod security policies

## Performance Optimization
1. Multi-stage builds reduce image size
2. Layer caching speeds up builds
3. Resource limits prevent resource exhaustion
4. Horizontal scaling for load distribution
5. Health checks ensure availability

## Best Practices
1. Tag images with git commit SHA
2. Use declarative Kubernetes manifests
3. Implement gradual rollout strategies
4. Monitor container metrics
5. Use init containers for migrations
6. Implement graceful shutdown
7. Document deployment procedures

## Notes
- Consider using Helm for complex deployments
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Use container registry for image storage
- Monitor resource usage and adjust limits
- Implement backup and disaster recovery plans
