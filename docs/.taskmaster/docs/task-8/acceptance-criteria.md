# Task 8: API Documentation and Developer Experience - Acceptance Criteria

## Overview
This document defines the acceptance criteria for implementing comprehensive API documentation, enhanced logging, and developer experience improvements for the Rust Basic API.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation

#### ✅ Dependency Integration
- [ ] `utoipa` crate added to Cargo.toml with version 3.0 and axum features
- [ ] `utoipa-swagger-ui` crate added with version 3.0 and axum features
- [ ] All dependencies compile without errors
- [ ] No version conflicts with existing dependencies

#### ✅ Documentation Module Implementation
- [ ] `src/docs.rs` file created with OpenAPI struct
- [ ] ApiDoc struct properly derives OpenApi
- [ ] All API paths are registered in the OpenAPI specification
- [ ] All model schemas are included in components
- [ ] API tags are properly defined with descriptions

#### ✅ Model Annotations
- [ ] User model implements `utoipa::ToSchema`
- [ ] CreateUserRequest model implements `utoipa::ToSchema`
- [ ] UpdateUserRequest model implements `utoipa::ToSchema`
- [ ] ErrorResponse model implements `utoipa::ToSchema`
- [ ] All models have appropriate schema examples
- [ ] Schema annotations include proper types and formats

#### ✅ Route Handler Annotations
- [ ] `health_check` endpoint has utoipa::path annotation
- [ ] `get_users` endpoint has complete response documentation
- [ ] `get_user` endpoint documents path parameters
- [ ] `create_user` endpoint documents request body
- [ ] `update_user` endpoint documents both path and body
- [ ] `delete_user` endpoint documents success and error responses
- [ ] All annotations include status codes and descriptions

#### ✅ Swagger UI Integration
- [ ] SwaggerUI mounted at `/swagger-ui` endpoint
- [ ] OpenAPI JSON available at `/api-docs/openapi.json`
- [ ] SwaggerUI loads without JavaScript errors
- [ ] All endpoints visible in SwaggerUI interface
- [ ] "Try it out" functionality works for all endpoints

### 2. Structured Logging

#### ✅ Logging Dependencies
- [ ] `tracing-bunyan-formatter` version 0.3 added to Cargo.toml
- [ ] `tracing-log` version 0.1 added to Cargo.toml
- [ ] Dependencies resolve without conflicts

#### ✅ Logging Module Implementation
- [ ] `src/logging.rs` file created
- [ ] `init_logging()` function implemented
- [ ] LogTracer properly redirects log events
- [ ] EnvFilter respects RUST_LOG environment variable
- [ ] BunyanFormattingLayer outputs valid JSON
- [ ] Logging initialization is idempotent (uses Once)

#### ✅ Logging Integration
- [ ] Logging initialized in main.rs before server start
- [ ] TraceLayer added to Axum router
- [ ] Request/response logging captures method, path, status
- [ ] Error logs include appropriate context
- [ ] Log levels properly differentiated (debug, info, warn, error)

### 3. Developer Experience

#### ✅ Development Scripts
- [ ] `scripts/dev.sh` file created with execute permissions
- [ ] Script checks for cargo-watch installation
- [ ] Script installs cargo-watch if missing
- [ ] Script starts PostgreSQL via docker-compose
- [ ] Script launches application with hot reload
- [ ] Script handles cleanup on exit (SIGINT/SIGTERM)

#### ✅ Environment Configuration
- [ ] `.env` file created for local development
- [ ] DATABASE_URL configured with correct connection string
- [ ] RUST_LOG set to appropriate level (debug for dev)
- [ ] SERVER_PORT configured (default 3000)
- [ ] Application reads .env file on startup
- [ ] Environment variables override defaults

#### ✅ Hot Reload Functionality
- [ ] Code changes trigger automatic recompilation
- [ ] Server restarts after successful compilation
- [ ] Compilation errors displayed without crashing watch
- [ ] File save triggers reload within 2 seconds
- [ ] Static file changes don't trigger unnecessary rebuilds

## Testing Requirements

### API Documentation Tests
```bash
# Test 1: Verify Swagger UI accessibility
curl -I http://localhost:3000/swagger-ui/
# Expected: 200 OK or 301 redirect to /swagger-ui/index.html

# Test 2: Verify OpenAPI JSON endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api-docs/openapi.json | jq .
# Expected: Valid OpenAPI 3.0 JSON specification

# Test 3: Validate OpenAPI specification
# Use online validator or openapi-generator validate
```

### Logging Tests
```bash
# Test 1: Verify JSON log format
cargo run 2>&1 | head -n 1 | jq .
# Expected: Valid JSON with timestamp, level, message fields

# Test 2: Test log level filtering
RUST_LOG=warn cargo run
# Expected: Only warn and error logs appear

# Test 3: Verify request logging
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Expected: JSON log entry with request details
```

### Developer Experience Tests
```bash
# Test 1: Run development script
./scripts/dev.sh
# Expected: PostgreSQL starts, application runs with watch mode

# Test 2: Test hot reload
# Modify src/main.rs while dev.sh is running
echo "// test comment" >> src/main.rs
# Expected: Automatic recompilation and restart

# Test 3: Environment variable loading
DATABASE_URL=test cargo run
# Expected: Application attempts connection to "test" database
```

## Performance Criteria

### Documentation Performance
- Swagger UI loads in < 2 seconds
- OpenAPI JSON generation < 100ms
- No measurable impact on API endpoint latency

### Logging Performance
- Structured logging adds < 1ms overhead per request
- Log writes are non-blocking
- No memory leaks from log buffering

### Development Performance
- Hot reload triggers within 2 seconds of file save
- Compilation time remains under 30 seconds
- Docker containers start within 10 seconds

## Security Considerations

### Documentation Security
- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded from OpenAPI examples
- [ ] No authentication tokens in documentation
- [ ] Production deployment can disable Swagger UI
- [ ] API documentation requires authentication in production

### Logging Security
- [ ] No passwords or tokens logged
- [ ] PII data sanitized in logs
- [ ] Log rotation configured for production
- [ ] Log access restricted to authorized users
